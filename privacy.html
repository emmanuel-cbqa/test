          <p>
            PrisonCalling (“We”, “Us”) is sensitive to your concerns about how we use the personal information we collect from you through PrisonCalling’s website (the "Site"). We take your privacy seriously, and has implemented this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") and internal policies and practices to keep your personal and financial information secure. The Privacy Policy covers PrisonCalling's treatment of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you use the Online Services.  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our <b><a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a></b> and therefore governs your use of the Online Services. By using PrisonCalling Online Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact Customer Care at <a href="mailto:customercare@prisoncalling.com ">customercare@prisoncalling.com</a>.
          </p>
          <br>
          <label class="med-text">What Information Do We Collect About Our Customers?</label>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p><b>Traffic Data.</b> PrisonCalling may collect a variety of visitor data such as IP addresses, browser settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, and clickstream data (collectively "Visitor Data"). The Site may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively "Traffic Data").</p>
          <br>
          <p>We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Cookies.</b> PrisonCalling may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), that allow PrisonCalling to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online Services, about his or her visit to the Site or use of Applications. PrisonCalling does not capture Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such order forms, will be limited.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Personal Information.</b> PrisonCalling requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information") to access and use PrisonCalling products and services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a PrisonCalling employee, and willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or other aspects of services offered by PrisonCalling.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Personally Identifiable Information includes but is not limited to: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii) "Financial Data" (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and verification code or bank account information).</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Calls/Electronic Communications.</b> In the regular course of our business, PrisonCalling may monitor and record phone conversations or email communications between you and PrisonCalling employees for training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not wish to receive email from PrisonCalling, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list by using the "Unsubscribe" link on any of the emails we send.</p>
          <label class="med-text">How Do We Use the Information We Collect and Do We Share the Information We Receive?</label>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>We use information we collect from the Online Services to communicate with you, process your orders, facilitate your transactions with our third-party Online Service partners, and inform you of offers and discounts. For example, you may receive a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to alert you if we need to temporarily suspend the Site for maintenance.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Opting Out.</b>  We send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to users who have registered on the site and to those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related or transactional communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting Customer Care at <a href="mailto:customercare@prisoncalling.com ">customercare@prisoncalling.com</a> or <b>(xxx) xxx-xxxx</b>. However, you can opt-out of promotional communications by using the "Unsubscribe" link and following the unsubscribe instructions in any electronic communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:customercare@prisoncalling.com "> customercare@prisoncalling.com</a>.</p>
          <br>
          <p>You may choose not to provide PrisonCalling with Personal Identifiable Information or you may turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to use the Online Services and browse its pages. However, PrisonCalling cannot process orders without Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
          <br>
          <b><p>We share customer information with third parties only as follows:</p></b>
          <br>
          <p><b>Order Processing.</b>PrisonCalling, sometimes with the assistance of a third party, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment through merchant account services, and to generate the products and services you order.  Your Contact Data may be used to follow up with you on transactions you initiate through Online Services, respond to inquiries made through Online Services, inform you of changes to Online Services, and send you additional information about PrisonCalling and its products and services.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Third Party Marketing.</b> Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third party offer or purchase a package that includes a third party offer, we may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Required by Law.</b> We may also disclose your personal information: as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a lawful request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal request.</p>

If such an event occurs, your Personally Identifiable Information may be treated like any other PrisonCalling asset and sold, transferred, or shared with third parties, or used in ways not contemplated or permitted under this Privacy Policy.
